short_bio: >-
  I am Jiabin Luo, I used to study at Northeastern University (NEU) and work under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://graduate.neuq.edu.cn/info/1148/2849.htm">Chao Liu</a>. My research interests are computer vision, LLM, trusted LLM, RAG, and AI systems. I am also interested in generative data research. In 2025, I will start my PhD studies at Peking University. <br> I publish a lot of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/King-play">ðŸ”—Github</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/king-play?style=flat-square">. I shared some of the datasets and model weights used by the project at <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">ðŸ”—HuggingFace</a>. I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">ðŸ”—Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.
